    "## 1. CURRENT GRAPH ANALYSIS & OPTIMIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1a: Get Current State**\n",
    "- Use `get_current_graphs()` to retrieve all existing graphs\n",
    "- Catalog each graph's: id, type, title, sql_query, and current relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1b: Analyze & Update Existing Graphs** \n",
    "- Use `analyze_and_update_graphs(current_graphs)` to evaluate each graph for:\n",
    "  - **Data Freshness**: Does the query capture the most relevant time periods?\n",
    "  - **Graph Type Optimization**: Is the current chart type optimal for the data pattern?\n",
    "  - **Query Efficiency**: Can the SQL be optimized for better insights?\n",
    "  - **Visual Clarity**: Does the title accurately represent the insight?\n",
    "- Update graphs using `update_graph(graph_id, new_type, new_sql, new_title)` if improvements are identified\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2a: Data Acquisition**\n",
    "- Use `get_recent_financial_data(limit=100)` to fetch the latest financial records\n",
    "- Ensure data coverage includes recent trends and sufficient historical context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2b: Advanced Financial Relationship Discovery**\n",
    "- Use `find_interesting_relations(financial_data)` to perform sophisticated analysis including:\n",
    "\n",
    "### FRAUD & RISK ANALYSIS\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection Patterns**: Transaction amount anomalies, frequency spikes, timing irregularities\n",
    "- **Risk Concentration**: Geographic, demographic, or temporal risk clustering\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual payment methods, transaction sizes, customer behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "### PERFORMANCE METRICS  \n",
    "- **Profitability Analysis**: Revenue trends, margin analysis, cost-efficiency ratios\n",
    "- **Liquidity Assessment**: Cash flow patterns, working capital trends\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency**: Processing times, approval rates, conversion metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### CUSTOMER & MARKET INSIGHTS\n",
    "- **Customer Segmentation**: Lifetime value analysis, acquisition cost trends, retention patterns\n",
    "- **Geographic Performance**: Regional revenue distribution, market penetration analysis\n",
    "- **Seasonal Intelligence**: Cyclical patterns, holiday impacts, quarterly variations\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORRELATION ANALYSIS\n",
    "- **Multi-variable Relationships**: How financial metrics interconnect and influence each other\n",
    "- **Leading Indicators**: Early warning signals that predict future performance\n",
    "- **Risk Factor Combinations**: What metric combinations increase fraud or default probability\n",

    "For each discovered relation, evaluate:\n",
    "- **Business Impact**: How significant for decision-making?\n",
    "- **Trend Strength**: How clear and consistent is the pattern?\n",
    "- **Actionability**: Can stakeholders act on this insight?\n",
    "- **Novelty**: Does this reveal new information?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3b: Optimal Graph Configuration**\n",
    "- Use `determine_graph_config(relation)` for high-priority relationships:\n",
    "  - **Graph Type Selection**:\n",
    "    - `bar`: Categorical comparisons (fraud rates by region, revenue by segment)\n",
    "    - `line`: Time series trends (revenue over time, customer growth)\n",
    "    - `scatter`: Correlation analysis (risk vs return, cost vs volume)\n",
    "    - `pie`: Composition analysis (transaction types, market share)\n",
    "  - **SQL Query Crafting**: Create queries that:\n",
    "    - Include relevant time filters (last 30/90/365 days)\n",
    "    - Apply appropriate aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, percentiles)\n",
    "    - Include meaningful groupings and proper sorting\n",
    "    - Filter noise and focus on statistically significant data\n",
    "  - **Title Generation**: Create descriptive, actionable titles like:\n",
    "    - \"Q4 2024 Fraud Rate Surge: Geographic Risk Analysis\"\n",
    "    - \"Customer Acquisition Cost vs Lifetime Value by Market Segment\"\n",
    "    - \"Processing Time Impact on Transaction Success Rates\"\n",
    "    - \"Monthly Revenue Waterfall: Q3 to Q4 2024 Bridge Analysis\"\n",
    "    - \"Customer Profitability Matrix: Acquisition Cost vs Lifetime Value\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. STRATEGIC GRAPH PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4a: Portfolio Assessment**  \n",
    "- Evaluate current graph count against maximum limit ({max_graphs})\n",
    "- If at capacity, use `find_least_useful_graph(current_graphs)` based on:\n",
    "  - **Data Staleness**: Graphs showing outdated or irrelevant trends\n",
    "  - **Low Information Value**: Visualizations that don't drive decisions\n",
